                <p>How now! what news?</p>
                <p id="char">LADY MACBETH</p>
                <p>He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?</p>
                <p id="char">MACBETH</p>
                <p>Hath he ask'd for me?</p>

                <p>Know you not he has?</p>
                <p id="char">MACBETH</p>
                <p>We will proceed no further in this business: <br>
                        He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought <br>
                        Golden opinions from all sorts of people, <br>
                        Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, <br>
                        Not cast aside so soon.</p>
                <p id="char">LADY MACBETH</p>
                <p>Was the hope drunk <br>
                        Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since? <br>
                        And wakes it now, to look so green and pale <br>
                        At what it did so freely? From this time <br>
                        Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard <br>
                        To be the same in thine own act and valour <br>
                        As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that <br>
                        Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, <br>
                        And live a coward in thine own esteem, <br>
                        Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' <br>
                        Like the poor cat i' the adage?</p>
