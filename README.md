Project: Scriptspeare

Description: The project focuses on creating media player controls for an 
interactive script player system, focused on usability, easy user 
interaction, along with the flexibility of making the options 
personalised for each individual user.

Creating each control element (play, loop etc), and allowing the user to 
customise their own control bar with the functions most relevant to them.
Configuring a fileâ€™s subtitle into an interactive text.
Greater focus on product/MVP frontend 
(expanded media controls; loop/trim files etc)
