ScriptSpeare
--------------

A web media player designed to facilitate exploration of Shakespeareâ€™s works. This is done by presenting a collection of films/audiobooks/theatre recordings alongside an interactive transcript of each play. By interacting with the text, users can jump to specific points in the accompanying media, compare how selected lines are performed in different adaptions and loop specific sections to memorise lines.

I worked on this project together with Ivan Delev, Muhammad Fahd Asif, Bita Fardroo, Erlend Frayling and Sofia Simola during our third year Professional Software Development course at the University of Glasgow. The project was requested by local start-up company Scriptate. Another team of developers worked on creating a database to store play adaptations and their respective transcripts; together the media player and the database formed a full web application which was delivered to the client and deployed at scriptspeare.co.uk. This is a copy of the repository my team maintained throughout the project on GitLab.
