<a href="#t=00:00:00,000"> RE-ENTER SEYTON. </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:02,060"> Wherefore was that cry? </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:03,180"> SEYTON. The Queen, my lord, is dead. </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:13,120"> MACBETH. She should have died hereafter; </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:18,680"> There would have been a time for such a word. </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:22,300"> Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:34,740"> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:40,120"> To the last syllable of recorded time; </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:45,820"> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:00:50,320"> The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:01:00,900"> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:01:08,300"> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:01:13,020"> And then is heard no more. It is a tale </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:01:19,160"> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, </a><br>
<a href="#t=00:01:28,040"> Signifying nothing.</a>
